## Idea behind Co-Help Chat-Bot
As we all are fighting against the corona pandemic, difficult situations may arise at any point in time, where the communication crisis is a major and common problem faced by us. At such times our contribution is to help people with correct and basic info about the pandemic and pass the message of being calm and help them mentally to face these
Situations positively.

Now we are in the era of making conversation via texting apps. So, similarly, we have used an AI-enabled Chabot for our solution. These Chabot need a one-time data storage and can handle the multiple numbers of users and their queries within no time. These features make chat-bots user friendly and provide them satisfactory results, without any strain of getting the wrong information.

The app mainly concerns about creating awareness among people in India. So, the Watson assistant (Chabot) is trained in a way that it can give answers in a pictorial way and also in Hindi, the mother tongue of India. Few answers are internet-based information which is updated continuously, like the corona case count. For providing such live news information, the Watsonassistant is interfaced with Watson discovery via IBM cloud function API.

The user will be provided with accurate live results and correct information from well-known certified websites like CDC, WHO, MyGov (India), etc. Also, information on lockdown, helpline details, health-related information is provided in brief. Through this solution, our aim is to create confidence and the right awareness among people via the communication platform provided by IBM services, with which the situations can be handled in a smoother way.
